# Our second lesson with programming in javascript: Part 2 â€” Numbers and basic operators
William Zhou | Friday December 21, 2018
## Core takeaway
### Up to now, we've mainly been defining our numbers or variables and not modifying them later on. In javascript, we have several operators we can use to do just that: + - * / ! 

<hr>

Today, we'll be looking at some of the 5 core operators in javascript.


#### The addition `+` Operator for addition
##### Number addition
Addition for numbers is pretty straightforward. \<number\> + \<number\> gives us another number that is the sum of the previous two. Let's have a look...

        1 + 0 + 1
        32 + 0.5
        12 + 0.

Basic arithmetic tells us that the result should be:

        2
        32.5
        12

Remember, no matter how you type the number (i.e. `0` vs `0.`, `0.0`, or even `0.0000`), the decimal point only appears as needed

##### String "addition" (concatenation)
You can add two strings together using `+` as well.

        'Hello' + ' world!'
        'What' + ' is ' + 'this'

becomes

        'Hello world'
        'What is this'


##### Mixed string and number addition
Numbers are converted to strings when added to a string:

        'The year is ' + 2018 

becomes

        'The year is 2018'

#### The `+` operator for converting a string to a number

Think back to Lesson2a and types. Remember that these two are different:

        '1'
        1

The '1' in quotes is a string, and 1 by itself is a number.
To convert '1' to a number, it's very simple: put a `+` in front.
